University Project code samples with redacted code elements

This was for my capstone project at University. Working in a team we were to design and implement a phone application whilst working through appropriate SDLC stages and interviews with stakeholders.\
In brief, the application was to be a knowledge-base style app which contains resources (Images, Audio files, Videos) and Question-Answer style articles. Articles are placed under their relevant headers for navigation.\
I was the member that coded the entirety of the phone application, while the other two members coded the backend Laravel website and APIs. During the 10 weeks we were given I self-taught myself React Native and developed the application.\
The application also handles in-app playing of video and audio files which are saved externally on the Laravel website as links, EG to Vimeo.\
