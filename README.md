University Project code samples with redacted code elements

This was for my capstone project at University. Working in a team we were to design and implement a phone application whilst working through appropriate SDLC stages and interviews with stakeholders.
I was the member that coded the entirety of the phone application, while the other two members coded the backend Laravel website and APIs. During the 10 weeks we were given I self-taught myself React Native and developed the application using EXPO and AXIOS.
